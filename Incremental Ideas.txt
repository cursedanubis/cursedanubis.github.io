Ultimate Goal: Challenge the Evil One 
	- Available when minimum number of divine archons have been summoned
	- Success on dependent on your army composition and number of units 


If you challenge a boss you're not prepared to face, you lose a portion of your units.

Prestige Shop - uses boss currency


Issues:
========================

- Collection of gold/minerals for upgrades (i.e. weapons, armor, boss drops)

- Magic casting unit collects gold

- Training page button causing iron currency to briefly change to gold amount - Fixed
