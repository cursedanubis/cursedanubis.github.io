BATTLE
=======

Goblins
-------
Concerned with the security of your land, your spymaster has made a list of enemies spotted by your scouts.
The list begins with a den of greedy goblins in the nearby oak grove.
Though they have not made any aggressive moves toward your people and your holdings, theses capricious hoarders of all things shiny remain a threat.



Bandits
-------
Scouts have reported sightings of a large group of marauders camped out on the plains. 
Outfitted in leather armor and wielding iron weapons, these bandits roam the outskirts of your town and periodically pilfer from your peasants.


Reclusive Hermit
-----------------
Your people have been warned away from the swampy western woods where the mists blanket everything except for the lone hovel at the center.
Its single occupant can be seen chopping wood and collecting wild plants from time to time, often singing to herself into a garbled, eldritch language.
Her age hides the true extent of her skills - she keeps visitors away with an array of throwing knives, all launched with terrifyingly great accuracy.
